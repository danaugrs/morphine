Homomorphic Encryption Library in Python

### Introduction
This implementation of homomorphic encryption is based on [Computing Arbitrary Functions of Encrypted Data](https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/easy-fhe.pdf) by [Craig Gentry](https://www.macfound.org/fellows/914/), published in [Communications of the ACM, Vol. 53 No. 3](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/3/76272-computing-arbitrary-functions-of-encrypted-data/abstract) in March 2010.
